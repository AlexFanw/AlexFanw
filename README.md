### ðŸ¥¤ About me
Welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Before that, I got my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://hust.edu.cn/) and M.Sc. degree in Big Data Technology from [HKUST]((https://hkust.edu.hk/)). Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss my research further.
